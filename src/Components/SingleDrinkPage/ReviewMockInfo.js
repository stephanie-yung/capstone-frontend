      comment: "As a cold brew fan, I was excited to try it, but I also was concerned it was still going to be too sweet for my taste. Still, I am always up for a fun experiment! It’s not like a total sugar-bomb bright-pink Frappuccino concoction with extra whip",

        comment: "I actually LOVED it — and was surprised. At first I just tasted the cold brew, no pumpkin. If your straw is fully in the cup, you don’t taste the pumpkin at all — it’s literally just classic cold brew. Then I just lifted by straw to try the foam alone, and the pumpkin cream was actually so good. REALLY. It was light and creamy, but also rich-tasting, with some good froth and a sweet pumpkin flavor that wasn’t overwhelmingly sweet",

        comment: "It's pretty similar to that Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew we all know and love, but with a pumpkin cream foam instead",

        comment: "After a few minutes it kind of all swirls together. You still get that rich, strong cold brew flavor but with a soothing sweet finish",
